There are several common searching algorithms used in virus scanners, including:

Signature-based scanning: This method involves comparing the files on a computer to a database of known virus signatures. If a match is found, the file is flagged as potentially malicious.
Heuristic-based scanning: This method uses algorithms that try to identify patterns or behaviors that are commonly associated with malware.
Sandboxing: This method involves running a file in a virtual environment and monitoring its behavior to see if it exhibits any characteristics of malware.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: This method uses algorithms that can learn from the data and improve its performance over time.
Behavioral-based scanning: This method involves monitoring the behavior of a file on a computer and comparing it to a database of known malicious behaviors.
Emulation-based scanning: This method involves running a file in a simulated environment, monitoring its behavior and comparing it to a set of predefined rules to determine if it is malicious.
